**When did it crash?**
- Did it crash when you were selecting audio?
- Maybe after clicking on *Start Inference* immediately?
- Maybe the progress bar was half way full?

**Can I have the original audio please?**
- Submitting the audio would definitely help me with the debugging.

**Tell me about your device**
eg: iPhone 11, iOS 17

**What is the application version?**
- Please try updating to the latest version, the issue might have already been fixed
eg: 1.0.1

**Anything else you would like to add?**
- Please enter any additional contexts here
